## Hi there!

Welcome to my little slice of the internet!

---

My name is **Nicholas Schwankl**, known in the classroom as **Mr.Sy** and on the internet as **Syber**.

I'm a NC Teaching Fellow and graduate of NC State University's Technology, Engineering and Design Education program. I'm not quite sure what I'm doing next, but it'll probably be related to the NC public school system.

You can find my resume [HERE](https://syber-space.com/pandoc_resume/output/resume.html).

## Making

I like to make stuff! I mostly work with 3D printing and Arduino-related DIY electronics, though I dabble in just about everything. My current long-term project is a [physical recreation of the game *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*](https://ktane.syber-space.com).

## This Site

I've created this site as a blog of sorts. I'll probably post small projects, interesting tips, education-related thoughts, and whatever else I see fit to toss out into the great blue yonder.

This site is built using GitHub's wonderful [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) system and forked from the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.info/) theme. I've found I really enjoy messing around in markdown compared to coding HTML or working in editors, so hopefully this sees more use than past attempts. *(No promises though.)*

I hope you find something you like!
