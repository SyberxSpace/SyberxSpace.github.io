## Registry Edits

I make these changes to my Windows registry to modify a few aspects of the OS. The first edit, `EnableHexNumpad`, allows me to use `ALT` + `+####` to input Unicode values instead of just the default alt codes. The second change, `DisableSearchBoxSuggestions`, prevents the Windows search bar from web searching.

```
Computer
└ HKEY_CURRENT_USER
  ├ Control Panel
  │ └ Input Method
  │   ► STRING • "EnableHexNumpad" • "1"
  └ SOFTWARE
    └ Policies
      └ Microsoft
        └ Windows
          └ Explorer
            ► DWORD • "DisableSearchBoxSuggestions" • "1"
```

**Note:** *Be careful if you decide to make these edits. Back up your registry or computer if you are not confident you know what you are doing.*

## Tools

These software packages add significant improvements to the Windows experience in my opinion. *I have no official relationship with any of these besides being a regular user of them.*

| [**AutoHotKey**](https://www.autohotkey.com) | Quick and easy macro creation and key reassignment |
| [**PowerToys**](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) | Adds system features like a color picker, fancy zones, image resizing, and more |
| [**STL-Thumbnail**](https://github.com/cabbagecreek/STL-thumbnail) | Allows Windows to render thumbnails on 3D models |
| [**SuperF4**](https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4) | Allows the killing of programs instantly with Ctrl+Alt+F4 |

I also find installing Ubuntu using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to be extremely handy as someone more familiar with the linux command line than the Windows command prompt.

## Useful Characters

I map these to keyboard combinations on my keyboard (it has hardware macro support), but they can be typed manually if needed.
